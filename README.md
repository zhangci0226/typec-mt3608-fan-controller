# Type-C Powered Desktop Air Purifier Fan - CleanFan (MT3608)

üéâ CleanFan is a powerful desktop air purifier fan, with dimensions of approximately 82mm x 82mm x 120mm. 5V input, MT3608 boosts to 12V for the cooling fan and 5V for the LED. It features a power switch and MOSFET-controlled output. The fan uses a 6025 (12V, 0.72A) high-power fan for strong airflow, efficiently removing solder smoke. Dual-layer filtration: inner layer is HEPA filter paper, outer layer is filter cotton (30ppi), reducing harmful substances. The strong airflow also helps cool down freshly soldered PCBs quickly.

## üåø Fan & Filtration

To efficiently remove smoke, a 12V 0.72A 6025 fan is used (2-wire is sufficient). The fan provides strong airflow for effective smoke removal. For filtration, a two-layer system is used: outer layer is 30ppi dust filter cotton for good airflow, inner layer is HEPA filter paper.

## üñ®Ô∏è 3D Printed Case

Directly use Twotrees slicing software, 0.4mm nozzle, standard 0.2mm layer height. The main case uses gray metallic PLA, internal parts use deep pink PLA, overall color scheme inspired by Dyson products. With blue LED, the effect is quite nice.

## üîß Usage

![Demo](img/demo.gif)

### During Soldering
1. Connect the Type-C cable to a power supply (5V/2A or above)
2. Toggle the switch to turn on the power
3. The fan starts running and removes solder smoke

### For PCB Cooling
1. Place the soldered PCB on the anodized aluminum mesh
2. The fan draws in outside air and blows upward
3. Cool air passes through the mesh, quickly cooling the PCB
4. The high thermal conductivity of the mesh accelerates cooling

### Dual Function
- **During soldering**: Removes smoke, protects health
- **After soldering**: Quickly cools PCB, improves efficiency
